# ğŸŒ€ ControlAny
**ControlAny** is our official implementation for controllable generation, supporting both images and videos while incorporating diverse forms of control information. In this project, we propose a new method that reduces trainable parameters by up to 90%, achieving faster convergence and outstanding efficiency. This method can be directly combined with other LoRA techniques to alter style and ensure more stable generation. Please refer to the examples for more details.

> ğŸ“¢ We are initially releasing our code with weights, and further details will be presented in our upcoming paper. Please stay tuned for updates.
